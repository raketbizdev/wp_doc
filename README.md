## Creating a New Post in WordPress Using The Default Editor
In December 2018, WordPress introduced a new modern block-based editor also known as Gutenberg. It is clean and simple, but don’t let the looks deceive you.

Behind its clean interface, there are tons of powerful features neatly tucked away. We’ll explain all of them and help you unlock its true potential.

## Adding Title and Content Blocks

To add content, you need to add a block. There are multiple add block buttons on the screen that you can click to select and add a block.

All content elements are wrapped in a block. WordPress comes with blocks for all the common content items including paragraph, columns, images, gallery, embeds, shortcodes, widgets, and more.

Some WordPress plugins may also add their own blocks to add other features like contact forms, SEO, etc (more on this later in the article).

## Adding Images, Videos, & Other Media

You can add images by simply adding the image block and then upload or select the image you want to add.

If you want to text and image next to each other, then you can use the ‘Media & Text’ block. This block helps you wrap text around the image in WordPress.

WordPress editor also comes with a Gallery block that you can use to display images in rows and columns with a grid layout.

Simply add the Gallery block and then upload or select the images from your WordPress media library.

# How to Embed Video

Want to embed a video in your content? No problem.

The default WordPress editor comes with embed blocks for all popular providers.

You can also just copy and paste the video URL to a paragraph block, and WordPress will automatically convert it into a video embed block.

## Adding Categories and Tags

WordPress allows you to sort your posts into categories and tags. These taxonomies help you organize your content into sections and topics.

They also help with SEO and make it easier for your users to find the content they are looking for.

The categories and tags meta boxes are located in the right-hand column, under the Document settings.

## Adding Featured Image

A featured image (also known as post thumbnail) is the main article image which represents the content. They’re prominently displayed on your website on single posts, blog archive pages, as well as on the homepage of news, magazine, and blog websites.

Almost all WordPress themes support the featured image functionality. You will find the option to add a featured image to your post in the right column under the Document settings.

Simply click on the ‘Set featured image’ button and then select or upload the image you want to be used as the featured image.

It’s important that you don’t confuse featured images with cover images which is a new feature. See our article on cover image vs featured image for more details.

## Adding Excerpts (Article Summary)

Excerpts are the summary of a blog post or article. Most WordPress themes can automatically generate the excerpt from the first few lines of your post.

However, this automatic excerpt may not always be meaningful or catchy. In that case, you may want to manually add an excerpt.

You can do so by adding it in the excerpt box located under document settings column on the right.

## Changing Post URL Slug or Permalink

By default, WordPress uses SEO friendly URLs for your blog posts. It automatically uses your post’s title as the permalink.

However, some users may want to change it to be more SEO and user friendly. There are two ways to do that.

You can click on the post title, and you’ll notice the option to change the permalink above the title field. Alternatively, you can change it from the Permalink tab under the document settings column.

## Changing Author

If you run a multi-author WordPress site, then you can also change a post’s author and assign it to a different author on your website.

You will find the option to change author under the ‘Status and Visibility’ tab in the right column.

## Turn Comments On / Off

WordPress comes with a built-in commenting system that allow users to leave comments on your post. You can turn off comments for individual posts from the Discussion tab under the Document tab.
