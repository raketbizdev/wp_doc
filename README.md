## Creating a New Post in WordPress Using The Default Editor
In December 2018, WordPress introduced a new modern block-based editor also known as Gutenberg. It is clean and simple, but don’t let the looks deceive you.

Behind its clean interface, there are tons of powerful features neatly tucked away. We’ll explain all of them and help you unlock its true potential.

## Adding Title and Content Blocks

To add content, you need to add a block. There are multiple add block buttons on the screen that you can click to select and add a block.

All content elements are wrapped in a block. WordPress comes with blocks for all the common content items including paragraph, columns, images, gallery, embeds, shortcodes, widgets, and more.

Some WordPress plugins may also add their own blocks to add other features like contact forms, SEO, etc (more on this later in the article).

## Adding Images, Videos, & Other Media

You can add images by simply adding the image block and then upload or select the image you want to add.

If you want to text and image next to each other, then you can use the ‘Media & Text’ block. This block helps you wrap text around the image in WordPress.
